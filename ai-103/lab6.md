# Build AI Agents with Portal and VS Code

**Estimated Duration:** 45 Minutes

## Lab Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will build an AI agent solution using Microsoft Foundry and the Foundry Toolkit for Visual Studio Code. You will create a Foundry project, configure an AI agent with custom instructions, grounding data, file search, and code interpreter capabilities. You will then test the agent in the Foundry portal and Visual Studio Code before developing a Python client application that interacts with the agent programmatically. Finally, you will configure the application environment and validate the agent's ability to perform policy searches, data analysis, and visualization tasks.

## Lab Objectives

   ![](./media/lab2new-p11.png)

### Task 2: Create and Configure the AI Agent

In this task, you'll customize the agent's behavior by defining instructions and attaching grounding data. You'll configure file search capabilities using an IT policy document and enable the code interpreter tool to analyze structured datasets.

1. On the **Microsoft Foundry** Home page, in the **Build an agent** section, select **Start building**.

     ![](./media/ai103l6-08-l1.png)

1. In the **Create an agent** window, enter the **it-support-agent-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />** in the **Agent name (1)** field, and then select **Create (2)**.

     ![](./media/ai103l6-08-l2.png)

    - The playground will open for your newly created agent. You'll see that an available deployed model is already selected for you.

1. In the agent playground, set the **Instructions** to:

    ```prompt
    You are an IT Support Agent for Contoso Corporation.
    You help employees with technical issues and IT policy questions.
    
    Guidelines:
    - Always be professional and helpful
    - Use the IT policy documentation to answer questions accurately
    - If you don't know the answer, admit it and suggest contacting IT support directly
    - When creating tickets, collect all necessary information before proceeding
    ```

      ![](./media/ai103l6-08-l3.png)
      
1. Download the IT policy document from the lab repository. Open a new browser tab and navigate to:

    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents/main/Labfiles/01-build-agent-portal-and-vscode/IT_Policy.txt
    ```

1. In Microsoft Edge, right-click the page and select **Save as**.

    ![](./media/ai103l6-08-l4.png)

    > **Note:** This document contains sample IT policies for password resets, software installation requests, and hardware troubleshooting.

1. In the **Save As** dialog, select **Downloads (1)** and then select **Save (2)**.

    ![](./media/ai103l6-08-l5.png)

1. Return to the agent playground. In the **Tools** section, select **Add (1)**, enable the **</> Code interpreter (2)** toggle and then select **Add tools (3)**

     ![](./media/ai103l6-08-l6.png)

1. On **Select a tool** page, under the **Configure** section, select **File search (1)** and click on **Add tool (2)**

      ![](./media/ai103l65.png)

1. Under **Attach files**, browse to and upload the `IT_Policy.txt` file you just downloaded, and then select **Attach**.

      ![](./media/ai103l66.png)

1. Wait for the file to be indexed. You'll see a confirmation when it's ready.

1. Now let's add some performance data for the code interpreter to analyze. Download the system performance data file from:

    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents/main/Labfiles/01-build-agent-portal-and-vscode/system_performance.csv
    ```

    Save this file to your local machine.

1. To the right of **</> Code interpreter**, select **+ Files**, and then upload the `system_performance.csv` file you just downloaded.

    > **Note**: This CSV file contains simulated system metrics (CPU, memory, disk usage) over time that the agent can analyze.

      ![](./media/ai103l67.png)

      ![](./media/ai103l68.png)
      
1. Save the agent.

   ![](./media/ai103l69.png)

## Task 3: Test your agent

In this task, you'll interact with the agent in the Foundry playground to validate its configuration. You'll test policy-based question answering, verify the use of grounding data, and evaluate the agent's ability to analyze datasets and generate visualizations.

1. In the chat interface on the right side of the playground, enter the following prompt:

    ```
    What's the policy for password resets?
    ```

   ![](./media/ai103l610.png)
   
1. Review the response. The agent should reference the IT policy document and provide accurate information about password reset procedures.

1. Try another prompt:

    ```
    How do I request new software?
    ```

1. Again, review the response and observe how the agent uses the grounding data.

1. Now test the code interpreter with a data analysis request:

    ```
    Can you analyze the system performance data and tell me if there are any concerning trends?
    ```

1. The agent should use the code interpreter to analyze the CSV file and provide insights about system performance.

1. Try asking for a visualization:

    ```
    Create a chart showing CPU usage over time from the performance data
    ```

1. The agent will use code interpreter to generate visualizations and analysis.

Great! You've created an agent with grounding data, file search, and code interpreter capabilities. In the next section, you'll interact with this agent programmatically using VS Code.

## Task 4: Interact with your agent using VS Code

As a developer, you may spend some time working in the Foundry portal; but you’re also likely to spend a lot of time in Visual Studio Code. The Foundry Toolkit for VS Code extension provides a convenient way to work with Foundry project resources without leaving the development environment.

In this task, you'll install and configure the Foundry Toolkit extension for Visual Studio Code. You'll connect to your Foundry project, access the agent created in the portal, and test its functionality directly from the development environment.

### Install and configure the VS Code extension

If you already have installed the Foundry Toolkit extension, you can skip this section.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

2. Select **Extensions (1)** from the left pane (or press **Ctrl+Shift+X**).

   ![](./media/ai103l611.png)
   
3. Search the extensions marketplace for the `Foundry Toolkit for VS Code` extension from Microsoft and select **Install**.

    Installing the Foundry Toolkit Extension will add the Foundry Toolkit extension to VS Code.

    > **Note**: The extension is currently listed as **Foundry Toolkit**, but some VS Code labels, commands, or older screenshots may still refer to **AI Toolkit**. In this lab, treat those names as referring to the same extension experience.

4. After installing the extension, select the Foundry Toolkit icon in the sidebar.

    You should be prompted to sign in to your Azure account if you haven't already.

### Test your agent in VS Code

Before writing any code, you can interact with your agent directly in the extension interface.

1. Under **Microsoft Foundry Resources**, choose **Set Default Project** and select **Sign in to Azure**

   ![](./media/ai103l612.png)
   
1. When prompted that the Azure Resources extension wants to sign in using your Microsoft account, select **Allow**to continue the authentication process.

   ![](./media/ai103l613.png)
   
1. Complete the sign-in process using the account provided for this lab.

    - **Email/Username:** <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>

    - **Password:** <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>
        
1. Wait for Visual Studio Code to finish connecting to your Azure account before proceeding to the next step.
  
1. Select the project that created in previous step.

   ![](./media/ai103l614.png)

1. Expand the project section. Under **Prompt Agents**, you should see the `it-support-agent-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false" />` you created in the portal. Select the agent name to open the Agent Builder interface.

   ![](./media/ai103l615.png)
   
1. The agent playground will appear in the Agent Builder interface, allowing you to interact with the agent and configure its settings without leaving VS Code.

3. In the playground chat pane, type a question such as:

    ```
    What is the policy for reporting a lost or stolen device?
    ```

4. Review the agent's response. It should use the grounding data you uploaded earlier to provide relevant IT policy information.

    > **Tip**: You can use this built-in playground to quickly test your agent's instructions and knowledge without writing any code.

## Task 5: Create a client application to interact with your agent

In this task, you'll clone a GitHub repository and develop a Python client application that communicates with your AI agent. You'll configure the application to send prompts, process responses, manage conversations, and handle generated files and visual outputs.

1. In VS Code, open the Command Palette (**Ctrl+Shift+P** or **View > Command Palette**).

1. Type **Git: Clone** and select it from the list.

1. Enter the repository URL:

    ```
    https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-ai-agents.git
    ```

1. Choose a location on your local machine to clone the repository.

1. When prompted, select **Open** to open the cloned repository in VS Code.

1. Once the repository opens, select **File > Open Folder** and navigate to `mslearn-ai-agents/Labfiles/01-build-agent-portal-and-vscode/Python`, then choose **Select Folder**.

1. In the Explorer pane, open the `agent_with_functions.py` file. If the file is empty, replace its contents with the following code.

1. Use the following code:

    ```python

            ):
                print(f"\nAgent: {response.output_text}\n")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```

1. Save the `agent_with_functions.py` file (**Ctrl+S** or **File > Save**).

## Task 6: Configure environment and run the application

In this task, you'll configure the application settings by updating environment variables, installing required dependencies, authenticating with Azure, and running the client application to establish communication with the AI agent.

1. In the Explorer pane, you'll see `.env.example` and `requirements.txt` files already present in the folder.

1. Duplicate the `.env.example` file, and rename it to `.env`.

1. In the `.env` file, replace `your_project_endpoint_here` with your actual project endpoint:

    ```
    PROJECT_ENDPOINT=<your_project_endpoint>
    AGENT_NAME=it-support-agent
    ```

    **To get your project endpoint:** In VS Code, open the **Foundry Toolkit** extension, right-click on your active project, and select **Copy Endpoint**. If **Copy Endpoint** isn't available in your installed version of Foundry Toolkit, open the Microsoft Foundry portal, go to your project, and copy the project endpoint from the project overview page instead.

1. Save the `.env` file (**Ctrl+S** or **File > Save**).

1. Open a terminal in VS Code (**Terminal > New Terminal**) and navigate to the working directory.

1. Install the required packages and login:

    ```bash
    python -m venv labenv
    .\labenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

1. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python agent_with_functions.py
    ```

## Task 7: Test the client application

In this task, you'll validate the capabilities of the client application by performing policy searches, analyzing datasets, generating charts and visualizations, and testing the agent's ability to combine file search and code interpreter tools to deliver intelligent responses.

When the agent starts, try these prompts to test different capabilities:

1. Test policy search with file search:

    ```
    What's the policy for password resets?
    ```

2. Request data analysis with code interpreter:

    ```
    Analyze the system performance data and identify any periods where CPU usage exceeded 80%
    ```

3. Request a visualization:

    ```
    Create a line chart showing memory usage trends over time
    ```

    The application saves generated charts and cited files to the `agent_outputs` folder and prints the local file path in the terminal.

4. Ask for statistical analysis:

    ```
    What are the average, minimum, and maximum values for disk usage in the performance data?
    ```

5. Combined analysis:

    ```
    Find any correlation between high CPU usage and memory usage in the performance data
    ```

Observe how the agent uses both file search (for policy questions) and code interpreter (for data analysis) to fulfill your requests. The code interpreter will analyze the CSV data, perform calculations, and can even generate visualizations. Type `exit` when done testing.

## Summary

In this exercise, you created and configured an AI agent using Microsoft Foundry and the Foundry Toolkit for Visual Studio Code. You enhanced the agent with custom instructions, grounding data, file search, and code interpreter capabilities to support intelligent responses and data analysis. You then tested the agent in both the Foundry portal and Visual Studio Code, developed a Python client application to interact with the agent programmatically, and configured the required environment settings. Finally, you validated the solution by performing policy searches, analyzing datasets, and generating visualizations, demonstrating how AI agents can combine multiple tools to deliver rich, context-aware experiences.

## Congratulations, you’ve successfully completed the hands-on lab!
